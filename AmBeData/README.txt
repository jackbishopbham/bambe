The data in this folder are laid out as follows:

- XS_0/1/2/3/b/t -> integrated cross sections for 9Be(a,n)12C for GND/1st/2nd /3rd excited state of carbon and 9Berillium reakup (b). Also total line has been sampled (t). From Geiger-Van Der Zwan-1975
- stopping_power -> empty
- n0/1/2_ang -> differential cross sections for GND/1st/2nd excited state of carbon

- PrimaryGenerator-ElossRange -> range data for initial alpha energy, calculated using Am241:110=16O:220=9.012Be:890 for 4He
- PrimaryGenerator-ElossEout -> resulting alpha energy data for range values, calculated using Am241:110=16O:220=9.012Be:890 for 4He
